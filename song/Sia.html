[Kendrick Lamar:]
Hey, I am the truth<br>
Hey, I am the wisdom of the fallen - I'm the youth<br>
Hey, I am the greatest<br>
Hey, this is the proof<br>
Hey, I work hard, pray hard, pay dues,hey <br>
I transform with pressure - I'm hands-on with effort<br>
I fell twice before my bounce back was special<br>
Letdowns will get you, and the critics will test you<br>
But the strong will survive, another scar may bless you, ah<br>
<br>
[Sia (Kendrick Lamar):]
Don't give up (no no), I won't give up (no no)<br>
Don't give up, no no no (nah)<br>

Don't give up, no no no
