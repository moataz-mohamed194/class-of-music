            Voices, a thousand, thousand voices<br>
Whispering, the time has passed for choices<br>
Golden days are passing over, yeah<br>
<br>
I can't seem to see you baby<br>
Although my eyes are open wide<br>
But I know I'll see you once more<br>
<br>
When I see you, I'll see you on the other side<br>
Yes, I'll see you, I'll see you on the other side<br>
<br>
Leaving, I hate to see you cry<br>
Grieving, I hate to say goodbye<br>
Dust and ash forever, yeah<br>
<br>
Though I know we must be parted<br>
As sure as stars are in the sky<br>
I'm gonna see when it comes to glory<br>
<br>
And I'll see you, I'll see you on the other side<br>
Yes I'll see you, I'll see you on the other side<br>
<br>
Never thought I'd feel like this<br>
Strange to be alone, yeah<br>
But we'll be together<br>
Carved in stone, carved in stone, carved in stone<br>
<br>
Hold me, hold me tight, I'm falling<br>
Far away. Distant voices calling<br>
I'm so cold. I need you darling, yeah<br>
<br>
I was down, but now I'm flying<br>
Straight across the great divide<br>
I know you're crying, but I'll stop you crying<br>
<br>
When I see you, I see you on the other side<br>
Yes. I'll see you. See you on the other side<br>
I'm gonna see you. See you on the other side<br>
God knows I'll see you, see you on the other side, yeah<br>
<br>
I'll see you. See you on the other side<br>
I'm gonna see you. See you on the other side<br>
God knows I'll see you, see you on the other side, yeah<br>
I wanna see you, yeah, yeah, yeah, see you on the other side<br>
God knows I'll see you, see you on the other side, yeah<br>
I'm gonna see you. See you on the other side<br>
