Ya Dig<br>
Mack, I'm going in<br>
<br>
A millionaire, I'm a young money millionaire<br>
Tougher than Nigerian hair<br>
My criteria compared to your career this isn't fair<br>
I'm a venereal disease like a menstrual bleed<br>
Through the pencil and leak on the sheet of the tablet<br>
In my mind 'cause I don't write shit, 'cause I ain't got time<br>
'Cause my seconds, minutes, hours go to the almighty dollar<br>
And the almighty power of that ch, ch, ch, ch chopper<br>
Sister, brother, son, daughter, father mothafuck a coppa<br>
Got the Maserati dancin' on the bridge pussy poppin'<br>
Tell the coppers hahahaha you can't catch 'em, you can't stop 'em<br>
I go by them goon rules if you can't beat 'em then you pop 'em<br>
You can't man 'em then you mop 'em,<br>
You can't stand 'em then you drop 'em,<br>
You pop 'em 'cause we pop 'em like Orville Redenbacher!<br>
Motherfucker I'm ill<br>
<br>


A million here, a million there<br>
Sicilian bitch with long hair<br>
With coke in the derri√®re<br>
Like smoke in the thinnest air<br>
I open the Lamborghini hopin' them crackers see me<br>
Like look at that bastard weezy<br>
He's a beast, he's a dog, he's a motherfucking problem<br>
OK, you're a goon but what's a goon to a goblin?<br>
Nothing, nothing -- you ain't scarin' nothing<br>
On some faggot bullshit call him Dennis Rodman<br>
Call me what you want bitch, call me on my sidekick<br>
Never answer when it's private, damn I hate a shy bitch<br>
Don't you hate a shy bitch?<br>
Yeah I ate a shy bitch<br>
She ain't shy no more, she changed her name to my bitch<br>
Hahahaha, yeah, nigga that's my bitch<br>
So when she ask for the money, when you through don't be surprised bitch<br>
It ain't trickin' if you got it<br>
But you like a bitch with no ass, you ain't got shit<br>
Motherfucker I'm ill, not sick<br>
And I'm OK but my watch sick, yeah my drop sick, yeah my Glock sick and my knot thick<br>
I'm it!<br>
Motherfucker I'm ill!<br>

Yeah<br>
See..<br>
They say I'm rapping like Big, Jay and Tupac, Andre 3000 where is Erykah Badu at? Who that?<br>

Who that say they're gonna beat Lil' Wayne<br>
My name ain't BIC, but I keep that flame man<br>
Who that one that do that boy?<br>
You knew that<br>
True that swallow<br>
And I be the shit now you got loose bowels<br>
I don't owe you like two vowels<br>
But I would like for you to pay me by the hour<br>
Ha ha, and I'd rather be pushing flowers<br>
Than to be in the pen sharing showers<br>
Ha, Tony told us this world was ours<br>
And the Bible told us every girl was sour<br>
Don't play in her garden and don't smell her flower<br>
Call me Mr. Carter or Mr. Lawn Mower<br>
Boy I got so many bitches like I'm Mike Lowry<br>
Even Gwen Stefani said she couldn't doubt me<br>
Motherfucker I say life ain't shit without me<br>
Chrome lips poking out the coup look like it's pouting<br>
I do what I do and you do what you can do about it bitch<br>
I could turn a crack rock into a mountain, dare me<br>
Don't you compare me 'cause there ain't nobody near me<br>
They don't see me, but they hear me<br>
They don't feel me, but they fear me.<br>
I'm illie<br>
