            I've wined and dined on Mulligan stew and never wished for turkey<br>
As I hitched and hiked and grifted too, from Maine to Albuquerque<br>
Alas I missed the Beaux Arts Ball and what is twice as sad<br>
I was never at a party where they honored Noel Ca-ad<br>
But social circles spin too fast for me<br>
My "hobohemia" is the place to be<br>
<br>
I get too hungry for dinner at eight<br>
I like the theater, but never come late<br>
I never bother with people I hate<br>
That's why the lady is a tramp<br>
<br>
I don't like crap games with barons and earls<br>
Won't go to Harlem in ermine and pearls<br>
Won't dish the dirt with the rest of the girls<br>
That's why the lady is a tramp<br>
<br>
I like the free, fresh wind in my hair<br>
Life without care<br>
I'm broke, it's oke<br>
Hate California, it's cold and it's damp<br>
That's why the lady is a tramp<br>
<br>
I go to Coney, the beach is divine<br>
I go to ballgames, the bleachers are fine<br>
I follow Winchell and read every line<br>
That's why the lady is a tramp<br>
<br>
I like a prizefight that isn't a fake<br>
I love the rowing on Central Park lake<br>
I go to Opera and stay wide awake<br>
That's why the lady is a tramp<br>
<br>
I like the green grass under my shoes<br>
What can I lose, I'm flat, that's that<br>
I'm alone when I lower my lamp<br>
That's why the lady is a tramp<br>
