I have nobody for my own.<br>
I'm so lonely, I'm Mr. Lonely.<br>
I have nobody for my own.<br>
I'm so lonely.<br>
<br>
Yo, this one here goes out to all my players out there, man, ya know,<br>
That got that one good girl who's always been there, man, like took all the bullshit.<br>
Then one day she can't take it no more and decide to leave.<br>
<br>
I woke up in the middle of the night<br>
And I noticed my girl wasn't by my side.<br>
Coulda sworn I was dreaming, for her I was feening.<br>
So I had to take a little ride.<br>
Back tracking over these few years,<br>
Tryna figure out what I do to make it go bad.<br>
'Cause ever since my girl left me my whole life came crashing and...<br>
<br>
I'm so lonely (so lonely),<br>
I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely),<br>
I have nobody (I have nobody)<br>
For my own (to call my own, girl).<br>
I'm so lonely (so lonely),<br>
I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely),<br>
I have nobody (I have nobody)<br>
For my own (to call my own, girl).<br>
<br>
Can't believe I had a girl like you<br>
And I just let you walk right outta my life.<br>
After all I put you through<br>
You still stuck around and stayed by my side.<br>
What really hurt me is I broke your heart.<br>
Baby, you were a good girl and I had no right.<br>
I really wanna make things right<br>
'Cause without you in my life, girl,...<br>
<br>
I'm so lonely (so lonely),<br>
I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely),<br>
I have nobody (I have nobody)<br>
For my own (to call my own, girl).<br>

I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely),<br>
I have nobody (I have nobody)<br>
For my own (to call my own, baby).<br>
<br>
Been all about the world,<br>
Ain't never met a girl<br>
That can take the things that you been through.<br>
Never thought the day would come<br>
Where you would get up and run,<br>
And I would be out chasing you.<br>
<br>
'Cause ain't nowhere in the globe I'd rather be,<br>
Ain't no one in the globe I'd rather see<br>
Than the girl of my dreams that made me be<br>
So happy but now so lonely.<br>
<br>
So lonely (so lonely),<br>
I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely),<br>
I have nobody (I have nobody)<br>
For my own (to call my own).<br>

I have nobody (I have nobody)<br>
For my own (to call my own, girl).<br>
<br>
Never thought that I'd be alone (be alone).<br>
I didn't think you'd be gone this long (gone so long).<br>
I just want you to call my phone.<br>
So, stop playing, girl, and come on home (come on home).<br>
Baby girl, I didn't mean to shout (no).<br>
I want me and you to work it out (work it out).<br>
I never wished I'd ever hurt my baby (hurt my baby).<br>
And it's driving me crazy 'cause...<br>
<br>
I'm so lonely (so lonely),<br>
I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely),<br>
I have nobody (have nobody)<br>
For my own (for my own).<br>
