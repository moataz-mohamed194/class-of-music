I got a reason to believe<br>
This love ain't gonna last the night<br>
You've opened my eyes, now I'm a little bit wiser<br>
A little bite colder<br>
There's no easy way<br>
To let you down and tell you<br>
I don't love you anymore<br>
Have a little respect, don't beg<br>
I don't need it, I never wanted it anyway<br>
So stop what you're saying<br>
It's more than I can take<br>
We've reached the end, there's no defense<br>
I had enough of this bad, bad, love<br>
Yeah<br>
Don't fool yourself<br>
I could never forgive you<br>
And I damn sure won't forget ya<br>
In Heaven or Hell every tear that I've cried<br>
Will come back to haunt you yet<br>
Don't be surprised if one of these mornings<br>
Bad luck comes knockin' at your door<br>
Oh, no, you'll find out<br>
Hell hath no fury like this woman that you've scorned<br>
Stop, don't say it<br>
It's more than I can take<br>
We've reached the end, there's no defense<br>
I've had enough of this bad love<br>
Don't be surprised<br>
If one of these mornings<br>
Bad luck comes knockin' at your door<br>
Have a little respect, don't beg<br>
I don't need it, it doesn't matter anymore<br>
Stop, don't say it<br>
Don't try to make me see<br>
We've reached the end, there's no defense<br>
I had enough of this bad, bad, love </marquee>
