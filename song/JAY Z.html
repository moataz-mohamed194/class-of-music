            If you're having girl problems I feel bad for you son<br>
I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one<br>
<br>
I got the rap patrol on the gat patrol<br>
Foes that wanna make sure my casket's closed<br>
Rap critics that say he's "Money Cash Hoes"<br>
I'm from the hood stupid what type of facts are those<br>
If you grew up with holes in your zapatos<br>
You'd celebrate the minute you was having dough<br>
I'm like fuck critics you can kiss my whole asshole<br>
If you don't like my lyrics you can press fast forward<br>
Got beef with radio if I don't play they show<br>
They don't play my hits well I don't give a shit SO<br>
Rap mags try and use my black ass<br>
So advertisers can give em more cash for ads...fuckers<br>
I don't know what you take me as<br>
or understand the intelligence that Jay-Z has<br>
I'm from rags to riches nigga I ain't dumb<br>
I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one<br>
Hit me<br>
<br>
99 Problems but a bitch ain't one<br>
If you having girl problems I feel bad for you son<br>
I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one<br>
Hit me<br>
<br>
The year is '94 and in my trunk is raw<br>
In my rear view mirror is the mother fucking law<br>
I got two choices yall pull over the car or<br>
bounce on the double put the pedal to the floor<br>
Now I ain't trying to see no highway chase with jake<br>
Plus I got a few dollars I can fight the case<br>
So I...pull over to the side of the road<br>
And I heard "Son do you know why I'm stopping you for?"<br>
Cause I'm young and I'm black and my hat's real low<br>
Do I look like a mind reader sir, I don't know<br>
Am I under arrest or should I guess some mo?<br>
"Well you was doing fifty five in a fifty four"<br>
"License and registration and step out of the car"<br>
"Are you carrying a weapon on you I know a lot of you are"<br>
I ain't stepping out of shit all my papers legit<br>
"Do you mind if I look round the car a little bit?"<br>
Well my glove compartment is locked so is the trunk and the back<br>
And I know my rights so you gon' need a warrant for that<br>
"Aren't you sharp as a tack are some type of lawyer or something?"<br>
"Or somebody important or something?"<br>
Nah I ain't passed the bar but I know a little bit<br>
Enough that you won't illegally search my shit<br>
"Well see how smart you are when the K-9's come"<br>
I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one<br>
Hit me<br>
<br>
[Chorus X2]

[Verse Three]
Now once upon a time not too long ago<br>
A nigga like myself had to strong arm a hoe<br>
This is not a hoe in the sense of having a pussy<br>
But a pussy having no God Damn sense, try and push me<br>
I tried to ignore him and talk to the Lord<br>
Pray for him, cause some fools just love to perform<br>
You know the type loud as a motor bike<br>
But wouldn't bust a grape in a fruit fight<br>
The only thing that's gonna happen is i'mma get to clapping<br>
He and his boys gon' be yapping to the captain<br>
And there I go trapped in the kit kat again<br>
Back through the system with the riff raff again<br>
Fiends on the floor scratching again<br>
Paparazzi's with they cameras snapping them<br>
D.A. tried to give the nigga the shaft again<br>
Half-a-mil for bail cause I'm African<br>
All because this fool was harrassin' them<br>
Trying to play the boy like hes saccarin<br>
But ain't nothing sweet 'bout how I hold my gun<br>
I got 99 problems but being a bitch ain't one<br>
Hit me<br>
<br>
[Chorus X3]

You're crazy for this one Rick<br>
It's your boy<br>
