            I do my make-up in somebody else's car<br>
We order different drinks at the same bars<br>
I know about what you did and I wanna scream the truth<br>
She thinks you love the beach, you're such a damn liar<br>
<br>
Those great whites, they have big teeth<br>
Hope they bite you<br>
Thought you said that you would always be in love<br>
But you're not in love, no more<br>
Did it frighten you<br>
How we kissed when we danced on the light up floor?<br>
On the light up floor<br>
<br>
But I hear sounds in my mind<br>
Brand new sounds in my mind<br>
But, honey, I'll be seein' you 'ever I go<br>
But, honey, I'll be seein' you down every road<br>
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it<br>
<br>
'Cause, honey, I'll come get my things, but I can't let go<br>
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it<br>
Oh, I wish I could get my things and just let go<br>
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it<br>
<br>
Sometimes I wake up in a different bedroom<br>
I whisper things, the city sings them back to you<br>
<br>
All those rumors, they have big teeth<br>
Hope they bite you<br>
Thought you said that you would always be in love<br>
But you're not in love, no more<br>
Did it frighten you<br>
How we kissed when we danced on the light up floor?<br>
On the light up floor<br>
<br>
But I hear sounds in my mind<br>
Brand new sounds in my mind<br>
But, honey, I'll be seein' you 'ever I go<br>
But, honey, I'll be seein' you down every road<br>
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it<br>
<br>
'Cause, honey, I'll come get my things, but I can't let go<br>
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it<br>
Oh, honey, I'll come get my things, but I can't let go<br>
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it<br>
<br>
Yeah, honey, I'll come get my things, but I can't let go<br>
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it<br>
Oh, I wish I could get my things and just let go<br>
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it<br>
<br>
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it<br>
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it<br>
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it<br>
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it<br>
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it<br>
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it<br>
