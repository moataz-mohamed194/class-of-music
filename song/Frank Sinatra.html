And so I face the final curtain<br>
My friend, I'll say it clear<br>
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain<br>
I've lived a life that's full<br>
I traveled each and every highway<br>
And more, much more than this, I did it my way<br>
<br>
Regrets, I've had a few<br>
But then again, too few to mention<br>
I did what I had to do and saw it through without exemption<br>
I planned each charted course, each careful step along the byway<br>
And more, much more than this, I did it my way<br>
<br>
Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew<br>
When I bit off more than I could chew<br>
But through it all, when there was doubt<br>
I ate it up and spit it out<br>
I faced it all and I stood tall and did it my way<br>
<br>
I've loved, I've laughed and cried<br>
I've had my fill, my share of losing<br>
And now, as tears subside, I find it all so amusing<br>
To think I did all that<br>
And may I say, not in a shy way<br>
Oh, no, oh, no, not me, I did it my way<br>
<br>
For what is a man, what has he got?<br>
If not himself, then he has naught<br>
To say the things he truly feels and not the words of one who kneels<br>
The record shows I took the blows and did it my way<br>
<br>
[instrumental]
<br>
Yes, it was my way<br>
