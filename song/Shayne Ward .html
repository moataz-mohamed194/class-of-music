            If our love was a fairy tale<br>
                                I would charge in and rescue you<br>
On a yacht baby we would sail<br>
To an island where we'd say I do<br>
<br>
And if we had babies they would look like you<br>
It'd be so beautiful if that came true<br>
You don't even know how very special you are<br>
<br>
You leave me breathless<br>
You're everything good in my life<br>
You leave me breathless<br>
I still can't believe that you're mine<br>
You just walked out of one of my dreams<br>
So beautiful you're leaving me<br>
Breathless<br>
<br>
And if our love was a story book<br>
We would meet on the very first page<br>
The last chapter would be about<br>
How I'm thankful for the life we've made<br>
<br>
And if we had babies they would have your eyes<br>
I would fall deeper watching you give life<br>
You don't even know how very special you are<br>
<br>
You leave me breathless<br>
You're everything good in my life<br>
You leave me breathless<br>
I still can't believe that you're mine<br>
You just walked out of one of my dreams<br>
So beautiful you're leaving me<br>
<br>
You must have been sent from heaven to earth to change me<br>
You're like an angel<br>
The thing that I feel is stronger than love believe me<br>
You're something special<br>
I only hope that I'll one day deserve what you've given me<br>
But all I can do is try<br>
Every day of my life<br>
<br>
You leave me breathless<br>
You're everything good in my life<br>
You leave me breathless<br>
I still can't believe that you're mine<br>
You just walked out of one of my dreams<br>
So beautiful you're leaving me<br>
Breathless<br>
<br>
You leave me breathless<br>
You're everything good in my life<br>
You leave me breathless<br>
I still can't believe that you're mine<br>
You just walked out of one of my dreams<br>
So beautiful you're leaving me<br>
Breathless<br>
